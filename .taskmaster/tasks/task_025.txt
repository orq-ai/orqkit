# Task ID: 25
# Title: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize performance for large-scale evaluations and add benchmarks
# Details:
Profile evaluation pipeline for bottlenecks. Optimize Effect.ts fiber usage. Add streaming support for large datasets. Implement result batching for orq.ai. Create benchmark suite comparing with similar tools. Document performance characteristics.

# Test Strategy:
Run benchmarks with various data sizes. Test memory usage stays bounded. Compare performance with baseline. Verify optimizations don't break functionality.
