### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, building, and releasing packages
### Details:
Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with jobs for: installing dependencies with Bun, running nx affected commands for tests and builds, running type checking and linting, generating and uploading coverage reports. Add release workflow in .github/workflows/release.yml triggered on main branch pushes, using nx release command with npm publish. Configure secrets for NPM_TOKEN and set up proper permissions.

## 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks with Biome [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Git pre-commit hooks using Biome for code quality enforcement
### Details:
Install husky as dev dependency and initialize with npx husky init. Create .husky/pre-commit hook that runs: bun run lint:fix for staged files, bun run format for code formatting, nx affected:test for affected test suites. Configure lint-staged to run Biome only on staged files. Add commit-msg hook for conventional commit validation using commitlint.

## 4. Configure Automated Changelog Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.3
### Description: Set up automatic changelog generation based on conventional commits

## 5. Configure NPM Publishing Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.4
### Description: Set up automated npm package publishing as part of the release pipeline
### Details:
Configure package.json files with proper publishing settings including access level, registry URL, and files to include. Set up .npmignore files to exclude unnecessary files from packages. Configure nx release to handle npm publishing with proper authentication. Add provenance generation for npm packages. Set up post-publish hooks for notifications or documentation updates.
