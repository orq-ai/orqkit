"""Example: Iterative agent instruction improvement with the hardening loop.

NOTE: This example uses two packages:
- evaluatorq.simulation.types — production SDK types (Persona, Scenario, Criterion, enums)
- agent_simulation — research package for HardeningLoop (not in production evaluatorq yet)

String literals (e.g. communication_style="casual") are used instead of enum values
because agent_simulation.models.persona.Persona uses Pydantic Literal types, not enums.
Pydantic coerces them correctly at runtime.

Demonstrates how to automatically improve an agent's system prompt by:
1. Running simulations to find failures
2. Diagnosing why the agent failed
3. Generating targeted instruction fixes
4. Re-running to verify improvement

This is especially useful when you have a set of test scenarios and want the
agent's instructions to pass them reliably.

Prerequisites:
    Install the agent-simulation research package (not on PyPI — install from source):

        uv pip install "agent-simulation @ git+https://github.com/orq-ai/research.git#subdirectory=projects/agent-simulation"

Usage:
    cd packages/evaluatorq-py
    uv run python examples/agent_simulation/04_hardening_loop.py
