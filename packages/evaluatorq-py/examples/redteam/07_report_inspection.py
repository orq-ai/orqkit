"""Inspect and export red team reports.

After a run, the `RedTeamReport` object contains structured results you
can query programmatically. This example shows how to:

    - Access the summary (resistance rate, vulnerability counts)
    - Iterate over individual results
    - Filter by vulnerability status
    - Export to JSON
    - Display a Rich summary table

Usage:
