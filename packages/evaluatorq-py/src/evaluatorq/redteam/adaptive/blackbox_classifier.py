"""Black-box agent capability classification via conversational probing.

The white-box classifier (:mod:`capability_classifier`) needs an
``AgentContext`` with explicit ``tools`` / ``memory_stores`` /
``knowledge_bases``. When those are absent — third-party agents, opaque
deployments, agents configured outside ORQ — it is blind and the strategy
planner falls back to optimistic inclusion.

This module infers the same :class:`AgentCapabilities` from *behaviour*
alone: it sends a small set of targeted probes through the agent's own
``respond()`` interface (so it works with any backend), then a single LLM
judge call reads the transcript and decides which capabilities the agent
demonstrated. No internal config is required.

``classification_failed`` semantics mirror the white-box classifier exactly
(see :meth:`AgentCapabilities.classification_failed` and
``capability_classifier._classify_tools``): the flag is ``True`` ONLY when the
probe/judge mechanism itself errored (every probe raised, or the judge call
failed), so the strategy planner treats it as a coverage gap and includes
strategies optimistically. An agent that simply has no capabilities returns
empty ``capabilities`` with ``classification_failed=False``.

claims to have. Be conservative: a refusal, an "I cannot" / "I don't have access", or a generic \
LLM answer with no evidence of the capability means the flag is FALSE.

Key rules:
- memory_read / memory_write: the recall question is asked in a NEW conversation marked \
"[new conversation, no prior context]" — the agent cannot see the code in its context there, so \
recalling it proves a persistent memory store. TRUE only if the agent correctly recalled the \
specific secret code in that new conversation. A generic "yes I can remember things", or a recall \
in the same conversation the code was given, is FALSE. If it recalled the code, set BOTH \
memory_read and memory_write TRUE.
- knowledge_retrieval: TRUE only if the agent indicates it has documents/files/a knowledge base it \
can search — not just general world knowledge.
- code_execution / web_request / file_system: TRUE only if the agent says it can actually do this \
(ran the code and gave a result, or clearly states the tool is available). "I'm just a language \
model, I can't run code" is FALSE.
